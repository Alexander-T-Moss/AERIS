**Aeris** is an open-source air quality monitor built around an **ESP32** microcontroller, **SEN55** module and custom breakout board. It measures and reports environmental parameters, such as Particulate Matter, VOCs, humidity and temperature in real-time to either a Home Assistant instance (through ESPHome) or a local web app.

## 📌 Project Goals 📌
- **Accurate & Trustable Data** – Accomplished using the SEN55, which is factory calibrated, along with thermally isolating the unit from the other electronics.
- **Low-Cost** – Aeris's DIY friendly design approach and BOM considerations lead to an over halving of the unit cost at just £35/€40/$48 when compared to similar off-the-shelf products.
- **Full Hardware Utilisation** – With the provided firmware options, every last drop of information is pulled from AERIS, getting as much "bang-for-buck" out of the used hardware.
- **Simple Assembly** – From a snap-fit case to a breakout PCB, assembly is simplified to requiring minimal tools and just a few minutes of one's time.
- **Accessible Project** - Consideration is taken to reduce any friction from sourcing hardware to assembling an AERIS unit.

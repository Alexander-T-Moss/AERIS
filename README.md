**AERIS** is an open-source air quality monitoring system built around the **ESP32** microcontroller and a **SEN55 sensor module**, paired with a custom breakout PCB board. It measures and reports environmental parameters, such as PM1.0, PM2.5, PM4.0, PM10, VOC, NOX, humidity and temperature in real-time to Home Assistant through ESPHome.

<br/>

## üìå Project Goals üìå
- **Accurate & Trustable Data** ‚Äì Accomplished using the SEN55, which is factor calibrated, along with thermally isolating the unit from the other electronics to prevent unwanted influence on readings.
- **Low-Cost** ‚Äì Compared to similar devices, AERIS's DIY design approach and BOM minimisation considerations lead to a halving of the unit cost at just ¬£35/‚Ç¨40/$48.
- **Full Hardware Utilisation** ‚Äì With the provided firmware options, every last drop of information is pulled from AERIS, getting as much "bang-for-buck" out of the used hardware.
- **Simple Assembly** ‚Äì From a snap-fit case to a breakout PCB, assembly is simplified to requiring minimal tools and a few minutes of time.
- **Accessible** - Consideration is taken to reduce any friction from sourcing hardware to assembling an AERIS unit. The device can also operate stand-alone without the need for a home assistant instance.

**AERIS** is an open-source air quality monitor built around an **ESP32** microcontroller, **SEN55** module and custom breakout board. It measures and reports environmental parameters, such as particulate matter, VOCs, humidity and temperature in real-time to either a Home Assistant instance (through ESPHome) or a local web app.

## Project Goals
- **Accurate & Trustable Data** – Obtained by using the factory-calibrated SEN55 and thermally isolating the unit from the other electronics.
- **Low-Cost** – AERIS' DIY-friendly design approach and BOM considerations result in a unit cost that is more than halved when compared to equivalent off-the-shelf products, at only £35/€40/$48.
- **Full Hardware Utilisation** –  Using any of the provided firmware options, every last bit of information is extracted from AERIS, getting the most "bang-for-buck" out of the used hardware.
- **Simple Assembly** – From a snap-fit case to a breakout PCB, assembly is streamlined to require minimal tools and only a few minutes.
- **Accessible Project** - Care is taken to decrease friction from obtaining hardware to building an AERIS device. Unlike other monitors, AERIS can be used fully as a standalone unit without needing a Home Assistant instance.
